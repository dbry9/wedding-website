                <h2>Her Story</h2>
                <p>On September 1, 2001- Nathalie was born. As many of you know, she was as extroverted as one can be. She had many dreams and aspirations. As a child, she had a fascination with outer space which drove her to dreaming of one day becoming an astronaut. Really soon, she discovered physics was not her strenght.  However, Nathalie has never been anything short of an overachiever; prioritizing her studies, at the age of 17 she didn’t just graduate high school but also got her associates degree. Her interpersonal intelligence knows no bounds, and it’s apparent in her completion in attaining her bachelors in Psychology, where she specialized in therapeutical work for children with autism. Fate would have it that she would follow in her future husbands steps and take a little vacation to Argentina for a bible seminar. If you were to ask her what the most life changing event she has ever lived, it would have to be her summer trip in Puerto Rico in 2021- since that is where her love story began. </p>

                <h2>His Story</h2>
                <p>Bryan's story begins with his birth in 1997. He was a very happy, loving kid who faced various health hindrances as a
                child but was able to overcome them. At the time, he wanted to be a movie actor and a priest. Though in his teenage
                years, he accomplished several milestones, such as becoming team captain of the varsity football team and graduating in
                the top 10% of his class. None of these compared to his encounter with God in the summer of 2015. He was never the same
                after that encounter, and God took him to other lands to know him more. Since then, he has been able to complete a
                family achievement by being the first in his family to receive a college degree. Though Bryan was able to achieve
                various things, he holds them in low regard compared to meeting, getting to know, and falling in love with his best
                friend. This November, Bryan will witness and take part in the greatest achievement a man can have: marrying the love of
                his life.
